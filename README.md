# Automatidata-project
Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Project background
Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

Build a dataframe for the TLC dataset

Examine data type of each column

Gather descriptive statistics

Your assignment
You will build a dataframe for the TLC data. After the dataframe is complete, you will organize the data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.

Specific project deliverables
With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:

Complete the questions in the Course 2 PACE strategy document

Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file

Complete coding prep work on project’s Jupyter notebook
